### Part 7 - Questions (and your Answers)

Acme Corporation isn't just a few `.py` files. If you want to grow in your
career here, you'll have to answer the following:

- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?
  
  Code Reviews in general are important as they help improve the use and readability of the code. I find one of the most 
  important pieces of code review to be simplicity in the creation of functions, classes and application of formulas. The
  simpler the code, the better it will run and the easier it will be to use. Therefore, I appreciate when I'm suggested
  an easier way to solve a problem with less or more straight forward code. Moreover, style also matters as we need to 
  be able to easily understand what is being coded and what the context may be.
  
- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?
    
    A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs 
    quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. For example, A Docker container image is a lightweight, 
    standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools,
     system libraries and settings. Therefore, A container provides a testing environment that will speed up testing so 
     that we can make sure the code works as expected in all environments. Moreover, running containers take less time
     and resources to run than virtual machines.
